/**
 * Queue class.
 * <p>
 * Have to use LinkedList<V> or Java bitches about unchecked types.
 * I ran into an error with my *public V dequeue()* method , Inside, I called my return removeFirst() method from my LL
 * Class,
 * Every bit of my code worked except for this one method call from the Queue class to the LL Class,
 * I checked the removeFirst() method in the LL Class and everything was fine.
 * It was giving me the error "uses unchecked or unsafe operations." . It was saying I wasn't returning the
 * right type (V) , but I was.
 * I decided to cast the type and it worked! However, after some research on Stack Overflow,
 * (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/197986/what-causes-javac-to-issue-the-uses-unchecked-or-unsafe-operations-warning),
 * I realized that "public class Queue<V>  insert V "extends LinkedList<V> {"
